## Overview
"The Internship v1” program is a DevC Lagos initiative where Project Managers, Developers and DevOps specialists are taken 
through a 13 week period where they build 10 real world software products distributed into 10 teams. 
These products could be Enterprise Apps, SaaS, Libraries or Utilities for “real world use”. 

## Goal!
At the end of the program, participants who make it through to the end will have a real world use app that they can show off as 
part of their portfolio.

## Specifications
Participants must build an app and ship it to production for use! That is the only specification. 

If you’re yet to notice, this program has only ONE vision: 
“At the end of the program, participants who make it through to the end will have a real world use app that 
they can show off as part of their portfolio.”

The Internship is totally remote and communication will be in The DevC Lagos Facebook Groups. 
Participants will be divided into teams and wil have to meet weekly deadlines to ensure that they remain in 
The Internship to the end. Participants who do not meet weekly deadlines will be eliminated from the Internship. 

The Internship rewards work done!

# There will be a weekly stipend to participants who deliver on tasks first!
